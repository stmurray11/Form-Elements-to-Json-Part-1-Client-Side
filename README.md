# Form-Elements-to-Json-Part-1-Client-Side
The javascript function dynamically builds a JSON string from the form elements, whether there's one element or a hundred.
Show the Json, then add a new field and show the Json again, and you'll see the power of it.

With both parts, you can add a form field and a corresponding database field, with no coding changes in between.
